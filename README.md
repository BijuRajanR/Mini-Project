Abstract:
          In this paper a four quadrant speed control system for DC motor has been designed, constructed and tested. The main advantage in using a DC motor is that the Speed-Torque relationship can be varied to almost any useful form. To achieve the speed control, an electronic technique called Pulse Width Modulation is used which generates High and Low pulses. These pulses vary the speed in the motor. For the generation of these pulses a microcontroller is used. As a microcontroller is used setting the speed ranges as per the requirement is easy which is done by changing the duty cycles time period in the program. Different speed grades and the direction are depended on different buttons. Experiment have proved that this system is of higher performance.
